## Reaction Graph Depth 1 (RGD1) database
This reaction database is generated by manuscript "[Comprehensive exploration of graphically defined reaction spaces](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02043-z)."

The additional data files are provided on [FigShare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/model_reaction_database/21066901). RGD1CHNO_AMsmiles.csv contains atom-mapped SMILES, activation energies, and enthalpies of formation for each reaction;
RGD1_CHNO.h5 contains the geometry information and energies; DFT_reaction_info.csv is supplied to reproduce figures in the article; RandP_smiles.txt is a dictionary to map the reactant and product smiles appear in RGD1_CHNO.h5 to a molecule index (molX); RGD1_RPs.h5 provides xtb and DFT optimized geometries of each individual reactant/product molecules.

* **Usage of python code**
    - parse\_data.py: This script parses all of the model reactions stored in a HDF5 file which can be freely downloaded from figshare.

    - make\_stat\_plots.py: This script parses the a csv file of reaction features and makes bar plots of different reaction features as DE\_break\_dist.pdf

    - draw\_violin.py: This script parses csv files of reaction features and DFT energies and makes violin plots of the activation energy distribution of different reaction types as reaction\_stat.pdf
